 - 👨‍💻 Some of my projects:
  - [Redefine web app](https://github.com/Andreas-Kalicani/Redefine): We   built this Website in two months by a team of 4 from scratch, using agile methologies, as final project in a web developer bootcamp for a client located in Denmark.  It's built with React, [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). The code was coded using NodeJS and Expressand, and MongoDB as a database. 

  - [TravelBudget](https://github.com/Andreas-Kalicani/travelbudget2.0): It was our second project dueing the bootcamp. A full stack application that calculates for people who is going to travel, the currency exchange from the country of origin to the country of destination using [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The frontend was coded using React and styled-components and the backend with NodeJS and Express. It includes a Mysql database deployed in Heroku. [Click here to see the project](https://sheltered-sierra-28595.herokuapp.com/)

  - [MyBackpacking](https://github.com/Axhar85/My-Backpacking): It was first project during bootcamp. We were given a task to create a website using HTML and CSS mainly, We were team of 2 pesrons. It was in the start though we have to work in HTML and CSS but we also use Javascript which we just start learning at the time of project. 

  [Smart Mars Watch](https://github.com/manuel-marque/hackathon-smars-watch): We took part in Hackathon. We have to create an applicatopn in 24hrs for an alone aastronaut who left alone at Mars. We came up an idea to create a smart watch which helps him to survive in harsh envoirment of mars and help him contact other aliens or planet.

- 🔧 A🔧 After learning the fundaments of web development on my own, I attended a "Web developer" Bootcamp at Wild Code School, that taught me the technical know-how and knowledge to develop interactive websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to take a React and Node JS development project to completion.
